# PyTorch Tutorials
Various PyTorch tutorials

### Files
- *01_neural_network_introduction.py* - It is a simple feed-forward network. It takes the input, feeds it through several layers one after the other, and then finally gives the output. (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/neural_networks_tutorial.html)
- *02_CIFAR10_tutorial.py* - Training a classifier tutorial for which it was used the CIFAR10 dataset. It has the classes: ‘airplane’, ‘automobile’, ‘bird’, ‘cat’, ‘deer’, ‘dog’, ‘frog’, ‘horse’, ‘ship’, ‘truck’. The images in CIFAR-10 are of size 3x32x32, i.e. 3-channel color images of 32x32 pixels in size. (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html)
- *03_pytorch_in_5_minutes.py* - PyTorch's key features and compare it to the current most popular deep learning framework (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbJ-2G2GXL0)
- *04_pytorch_in_10_minutes.py* - understanding of neural networks narrowed down to the most basics to help read PyTorch code. This is based on Justin Johnson’s great tutorial (https://github.com/jcjohnson/pytorch-examples). If you want to learn more or have more than 10 minutes for a PyTorch starter go read that (https://hsaghir.github.io/data_science/pytorch_starter/)
